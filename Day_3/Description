Initialization:
      result array is created with elements from 1 to n initially, where n is the length of the given pattern.

Iterating through the Pattern:
      The code iterates through the pattern and identifies sequences of 'D' (decreasing).
      When 'D' is found, it locates the start and end indices of the decreasing sequence in the result array.

Reversing Decreasing Sequences:
      The reverse function is called to reverse the identified decreasing sequences in the result array.

Building the Final String:
      Finally, the result array, which now holds the arranged sequence based on the pattern, is converted into a string and returned.
Time Complexity:
      The time complexity of this code is O(N)
