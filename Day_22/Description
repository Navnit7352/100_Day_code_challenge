MyStack Class:
    Contains an integer variable top initialized to -1 to represent the top of the stack.
    Declares an integer array arr of size 1000 to store stack elements.

push Method:
    Adds an integer a to the stack.
    Increments the top pointer and assigns the value a to the corresponding index in the arr array.

pop Method:    
    Removes the top item from the stack.
    Checks if the stack is empty (top == -1):
    If empty, returns -1 (an indicator for an empty stack).
    If the stack is not empty, returns the element at the current top index in the arr array and then decrements top to simulate popping the element.

Time Complexity:
    Push and pop operations generally have a time complexity of O(1) due to direct access to elements in the array.
