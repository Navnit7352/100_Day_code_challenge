Constructor (twoStacks()):
    Initializes the size of the array and sets top1 to -1 (indicating an empty stack 1) 
    and top2 to size (indicating an empty stack 2).

push1(int x):
    Adds an element x to stack 1 by incrementing top1 and assigning x to the array at index top1.

push2(int x):
    Adds an element x to stack 2 by decrementing top2 and assigning x to the array at index top2.

pop1():
    Removes and returns the element from the top of stack 1 (arr[top1]), and decrements top1.
    If stack 1 is empty (top1 == -1), it returns -1 as an indication of an empty stack.

pop2():
    Removes and returns the element from the top of stack 2 (arr[top2]), and increments top2.
    If stack 2 is empty (top2 == 100), it returns -1 as an indication of an empty stack.

Time Complexity:
    Push operations (push1 and push2): 
          time complexity of the both push function is O(1).

    Pop operations (pop1 and pop2):
          Similarly, both operations run in constant time O(1).
