Variables:
    front and rear: These variables keep track of the front and rear positions of the queue, respectively.
    arr[]: It's an array used to store the elements of the queue.

Constructor:
    MyQueue(): Initializes the queue by setting both front and rear to 0.

push(int x):
    Adds an element x to the queue by assigning it to the position indicated by rear and then incrementing rear. This operation effectively adds the element to the end of the queue.

pop():
    Checks if the queue is empty (front == rear). If it is, it returns -1 to indicate that the queue is empty.
    If the queue is not empty, it retrieves the element at the front (arr[front]), increments front, and returns the retrieved element.

Time Complexity:
    Push Operation:
      The time complexity of push operation is O(1) on average.
    Pop Operation:
      The time complexity of the pop operation is also O(1) on average
