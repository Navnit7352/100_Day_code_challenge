pattern Method:
    It takes an integer N as input and returns a List of Integers.
    Creates an ArrayList ans to store the pattern.
    Initializes k to the value of N.
    Adds the initial value N to the ans list.
    Enters a while loop that continues as long as k is greater than 0:
    Decrements k by 5 in each iteration.
    Adds the decremented value of k to the ans list.
    After the first while loop ends, it enters another while loop:
    Checks if k has reached the original value N.
    If k equals N, returns the generated pattern ans.
    Increments k by 5 in each iteration.
    Adds the incremented value of k to the ans list.
    If the loop doesn't return within the second while loop, it eventually returns the ans list.

Time Comlexity:
    the time complexity of this method is O(N).
