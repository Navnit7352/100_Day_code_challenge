Length Check:
    The code first checks if the lengths of the two input strings str1 and str2 are different. If they are, the strings cannot be isomorphic, so it returns false.
    Mapping and Sets:
    It uses a HashMap called mapping to store the mapping of characters from str1 to str2.
    It also uses a HashSet called visited to keep track of characters in str2 that have already been mapped.

Iterating through Strings:
    The code iterates through both strings simultaneously using a loop. For each character pair (char1 from str1 and char2 from str2) at the same position:
    If char1 is already in the mapping:
    It checks if the mapping of char1 to char2 is consistent. If not, it means there's a conflict in the mapping, so it returns false.
    If char1 is not in the mapping:
    It checks if char2 has already been visited and mapped to another character from str1. If it has, it means there can't be a one-to-one mapping, so it returns false.
    Otherwise, it creates a new mapping of char1 to char2 and marks char2 as visited.

Returning Result:
    If the loop completes without conflicts, it means the strings are isomorphic, so it returns true.

Time Complexity:
    The time complexity of this code is O(N)
