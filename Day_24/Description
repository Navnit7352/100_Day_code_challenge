int x = arr[arr.length - 1]:
    This line stores the last element of the array (arr) in a variable x. This element will be the one moved to the beginning of
    the array during the rotation.

for (int i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) 
{ 
  arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
}: 
    This loop iterates through the array from the last element to the second element. It shifts each element one position to the right, 
    effectively rotating the array to the right.

arr[0] = x:
    After the loop, the first element of the array is set to the value stored in variable x.
    This step completes the rotation, as the original last element is now at the beginning of the array.

Time complexity: 
    Time complexity of this code is O(N).
