Length Check:
    The code initially checks if the lengths of the two input strings, str1 and str2, are different. If they are, it directly returns false, as strings with different lengths cannot be rotations of each other.
    Special Case Handling:
    If the length of the strings is less than 2, it checks if str1 is equal to str2. If they are the same (both empty strings or single-character strings), 
    it returns true. This handles cases where the strings are trivially considered rotations of each other.

Rotation Generation:
    For strings longer than 2 characters:
    It generates two rotations of str1:
    clockwiseRotation by taking the last two characters and appending the remaining characters in front.
    anticlockwiseRotation by taking the first two characters and appending the rest after them.

Comparison:
    It checks if str2 matches either the clockwise or anticlockwise rotation of str1. If str2 matches either of these rotations,
    it returns true, indicating that str2 can be obtained by rotating str1 by exactly 2 places.

Time Complexity:
    The time complexity of this code is O(N)
