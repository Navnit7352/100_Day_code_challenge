Question:   Given a matrix of size N x N. Print the elements of the matrix in the snake like pattern depicted below.
            Complete the function snakePattern() that takes matrix as input parameter and returns a list of integers in order of 
            the values visited in the snake pattern.

Solution's Desciption:
          It initializes an ArrayList<Integer> called snake to store the elements visited in the snake pattern.
          It calculates the size of the square matrix by getting the length of the input matrix matrix.length.
          The code then loops through each row of the matrix (for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)) and appends elements to the snake list.
          For even-indexed rows (if (i % 2 == 0)), it traverses the row from left to right and adds each element to the snake list.
          For odd-indexed rows, it traverses the row from right to left and adds each element to the snake list.
          Finally, it returns the snake list containing the elements visited in the snake pattern.
          Time complexity:
              The time complexity of this code is O(N^2).
