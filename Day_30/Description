Function Signature:
    productExceptSelf(int nums[], int n): This function takes in an array nums of integers and its length n.
      
Variable Initialization:
    long product = 1;: Initialize a variable product to hold the product of all non-zero elements in the array.
    long arr[] = new long[n];: Initialize a result array of long integers of the same size as the input array.

Loop Through the Array:    
    Iterate through the input array nums.
    If the current element is zero, keep track of the count of zeros (zeroCount) and the index of the zero (zeroIndex).
    Otherwise, multiply the current element with the product.
      
Handle Zeroes:
    If there are more than 1 zero in the input array, return an array of zeros since it's impossible to compute the product in this case.
    If there are no zeros in the array, calculate each element in the result array by dividing the product by the corresponding element in the input array.
    If there's exactly one zero, place the calculated product at the index of that zero in the result array.
    Return the Result Array.

Time Complexity:
    Time complexity of this code is O(N).
