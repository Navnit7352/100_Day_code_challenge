Initialization:
    A StringBuilder named ans is created to construct the resultant string.
    Initially, ans is filled with '0' characters to form a string of length n.
    Variable k is decremented by 1.

HashSet for Tracking Unique Substrings:
    A HashSet named visited is created to keep track of unique substrings encountered while generating the resultant string. It starts by adding the initial '0' string.

String Generation:
    The code enters a while loop that continues until the visited set contains all possible unique strings of length n with digits from '0' to 'k'.
    It extracts the substring of length n - 1 from the end of the current ans string.
    Within this loop, it iterates from k down to 0:
    Constructs a new string currStr by appending a digit from '0' to 'k' to the previously extracted substring.
    Checks if this newly generated string currStr is present in the visited set. If not, it's added to the set, and the corresponding digit is appended to the ans string.
    Breaks out of the loop to proceed with the next iteration.

Return:
    Once all unique strings of length n with digits from '0' to 'k' have been generated, it returns the resulting string.

Time Complexity:
    The while loop runs until all unique strings of length n with digits '0' to 'k' are generated.
