Initialization:
    Map<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();: Initializes a HashMap map to store the frequency of each element in the array.
    int val = n/k;: Calculates the threshold value, which is the minimum count required for an element to appear more than n/k times in the array.
    int count = 0;: Initializes a counter to keep track of the elements that meet the condition.

Counting Frequencies:
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++): Loops through the array elements.
    map.put(arr[i], map.getOrDefault(arr[i],0) + 1);: Updates the frequency count for each element in the map.

Checking Elements Meeting Criteria:
    for(Map.Entry<Integer,Integer> temp : map.entrySet()): Iterates through the entries in the map.
    if(temp.getValue() > val) count++;: Checks if the count of occurrences of the current element (temp) in the map is greater than the calculated threshold val. 
    If so, increments the count.

Return:
    return count;: Returns the count of elements that appear more than n/k times in the array.
