Initialization: 
    Set up variables to track the result list (result) and its tail (tail).

Loop through the Lists:
    While both lists have elements:

Compare the current elements of both lists.
    If the elements are equal, an intersection is found. Add this value to the result list.
    Move to the next elements in both lists based on their values.
    Return the Result List: Once the loop finishes, return the resulting list containing the intersecting elements.

The time complexity is efficient:
    The code traverses both lists simultaneously, completing in O(min(m, n)) time, where m and n are the lengths of the input lists.
