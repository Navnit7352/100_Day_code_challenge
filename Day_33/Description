Sorting the array:
      Initially, the array a[] is sorted in ascending order.

Iterating through the array:
      The code starts iterating through the sorted array.
      If k becomes zero or all remaining negative numbers have been converted to positive, the loop breaks.
      When a negative number is encountered, it is converted to a positive number (a[i] *= -1) and k is decremented.

Check remaining k and perform additional conversions:      
      If after the initial pass through the array there are still remaining operations (k != 0), it indicates that all negative numbers have been converted to positive, but there are remaining operations to perform.
      In this case, it sorts the array again (which isn't necessary if k operations are remaining).
      Then, it iterates from index 0 and makes elements negative (a[0] = -a[0]) while decrementing k.

Summation and return:
      Finally, the code calculates the sum of all elements in the modified array and returns the sum.

Time Complexity:
      Sorting the array initially takes O(n log n)
