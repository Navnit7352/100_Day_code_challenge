palinArray Method:
    Takes an array a and an integer n as inputs.
    Iterates through each number num in the array a.

For each num:
    Initializes variables: original (to store the original number), reversed (to store the reversed number), and remainder.
    Enters a while loop that continues until num becomes 0:

Within the loop:
    Calculates the last digit of num using modulo 10 and stores it in remainder.
    Updates reversed by appending the digit at the end.
    Reduces num by removing its last digit (division by 10).
    Compares the original number (original) with the reversed number (reversed).
    If they are not equal (i.e., not a palindrome), the method returns 0.
    If all numbers in the array are palindromes, the method returns 1.
Time Complexity:
    the number of digits as 'd' and the number of elements as 'n', the time complexity can be approximated as O(d * n).
