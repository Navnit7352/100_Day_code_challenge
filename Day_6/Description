Initialization:
    It initializes a 2D array scs with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) to store the lengths of the shortest common supersequences of substrings of X and Y.

Populating the Table:
    It uses a dynamic programming approach to fill in the scs table. The logic is based on comparing substrings of X and Y to find the shortest common supersequence length.
    It iterates through the table and applies the following rules:
    If i (substring of X) is empty, then the length of the supersequence is the length of j (substring of Y), so scs[i][j] = j.
    If j (substring of Y) is empty, then the length of the supersequence is the length of i (substring of X), so scs[i][j] = i.
    If the characters at X[i-1] and Y[j-1] are the same, then the supersequence length is 1 + scs[i-1][j-1].
    If the characters are different, the supersequence length is 1 + min(scs[i-1][j], scs[i][j-1]), considering two possibilities of selecting characters from either X or Y.

Return:
    The function returns scs[m][n], which holds the length of the shortest common supersequence of the entire strings X and Y.

Time Complexity:
    The time complexity of this code is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of strings X and Y, respectively.
