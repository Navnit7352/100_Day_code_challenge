valueEqualToIndex Method:
    Takes an integer array arr and an integer n as inputs.
    Creates an ArrayList equal to store elements where the value is equal to its index.
    Iterates through the array using a for loop:
    Checks if the value at the current index (arr[i]) is equal to i + 1 (1-based index).
    If the condition holds true, adds i + 1 to the equal ArrayList.
    Returns the equal ArrayList containing elements that satisfy the condition.

Time Complexity:
    The time complexity of this code is O(n)
