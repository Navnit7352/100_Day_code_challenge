Input:
    The function removeDuplicates takes a string str as input.

Processing:
    It initializes an empty ArrayList of characters (li) to store unique characters.
    It iterates through each character in the input string.
    For each character encountered, if it's not already present in the li list, it adds that character to the list.

String Building:
    After collecting unique characters in the list, it uses a StringBuilder (sb) to construct a string.
    It appends each unique character from the list to the StringBuilder.

Return: 
    Finally, it converts the StringBuilder content into a string and returns that string.

Time complexity:
    time complexity of this code is O(N^2).
