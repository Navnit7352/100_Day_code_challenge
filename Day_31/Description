Function Maximize:
    Takes in an array of integers arr and its size n as parameters.

Condition Check:
    The code starts by checking if the first element of the array is equal to 30647.
    If it is, the function immediately returns the value 142256176 without performing any further operations. 
    This appears to be a specific case optimization or a hardcoded output for a certain input condition.

Array Sorting: 
    If the first element is not 30647, the code proceeds to sort the array in ascending order using Arrays.sort(arr).
    Sorting is a common operation to reorganize elements in ascending or descending order.

Calculation of Sum:
    Then, a for loop iterates through the array from the second element (i=1) to the last element (i<n).
    For each element at index i, it calculates the following:

    i * arr[i] % 1000000007
    Adds this value to the sum variable.
    Performs a modulo operation % 1000000007 on sum to keep the value within certain bounds.

Return:
    Finally, the function returns the sum after the loop iteration. It casts sum as an integer before returning.

Time Complexity:
    The sorting operation (Arrays.sort(arr)) has a time complexity of O(n log n)
