Input: The method maxSum takes in two parameters:

arr: An array of long integers.
n: An integer representing the size of the array.
Functionality:

The code first sorts the input array arr in ascending order using Arrays.sort(arr).
It initializes two pointers, b and l, pointing to the beginning and end of the sorted array respectively (b = 0 and l = n-1).
Then, it iterates through the array while the b pointer is less than or equal to the l pointer.
At each step, it calculates the absolute difference between the elements pointed to by b and l in the sorted array and adds this absolute difference to the sum.
It then increments b and decrements l.
Finally, it returns 2 * sum.
Time Complexity:

Sorting the array using Arrays.sort(arr) takes O(n log n) time complexity on average.
