Initialization:
    mod is set to 1000000007.
    Arrays lastPos1 and lastPos2 are created to store the last position of each character encountered in str1 and str2, respectively.
    Arrays dp1 and dp2 are created to store the count of distinct subsequences at each position of str1 and str2, respectively.
    The initial values of dp1[0] and dp2[0] are set to 1.

Dynamic Programming Approach:
    Two loops iterate through the length of the strings, from 1 to n.
    For each position i, the code calculates the count of distinct subsequences up to that position using dynamic programming.
    It computes dp1[i] and dp2[i] by doubling the previous count (2 * dp1[i - 1] and 2 * dp2[i - 1]) and adjusts this count based on the last occurrence of the character.
    If the character at the current position has been encountered before, it subtracts the count of subsequences that have already been counted before the last occurrence of that character.

Comparison:
    After calculating the counts of distinct subsequences for both strings, the code compares the counts (dp1[n] and dp2[n]) at the end of the strings.
    It returns the string with the higher count of distinct subsequences as the "better" string.

Time Complexity:
    The code utilizes two loops that iterate through the length of the strings, performing constant-time operations within each loop. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings str1 and str2.
